  b. Load and Effort (or M1 and M2)
  c. Mechanical Advantage
  d. Ratio of distance to fulcrum
  e.(2 Dimension, 3 Dimensions -> N dimensions)
2. Apply to finance
  a. Debt-to-equity -> balance sheet analogy
  b. introduce dynamic change -> leveraged degen traders

# What is leverage?

"Give me a lever long enough, and a fulcrum on which to place it -- and I shall move the world." -Archimedes

Leverage in the mechanical sense involves a **lever**, a **fulcrum**, an **input force** and an **output force**.
In a static context leverage provides a way to balance these two forces.
In a dynamic context the input force (**effort**) is translated into a desired output force (**load**).
This translation of forces is achieved by placing the two forces on either side of a beam (lever) and placing that beam on a fulcrum.
We will start by looking at the static context, where we try to always balance the two forces.
This means that the lever connects these two forces through space and the position of the fulcrum defines how the **effort** (input force) is translated into the **load** (output force).
Leverage provides  **mechanical advantage (MA)**: For a given input **effort** more output **load** can be "balanced".

The Cambridge Dictionary states: "to use something that you already have in order to achieve something new or better". 

## Leverage in the mechanical/physical sense

Archimedes' *Law of the Lever*: $MA = Load / Effort$

input and output vs. effort and load vs. equity and portfolio value

the fulcrum introduces friction (transaction costs in finance)
reference britisch meaning of gearing -> leverage is a connects 


In mechanics leverage involves a lever. 
The simplest lever consists of a beam capable of pivoting on a fulcrum (or hinge) that is placed in the middle of the beam, so basically a see-saw?. 
People familiar with levers might contest here and say that it is stupid to put the fulcrum exactly in the middle because there is no mechanical (force?) advantage gained. 
This is true in the sense that forces on either side of the lever have to be the same to balance but the point I'm trying to make is that
even with simple setup I can exert force somewhere else on the plain. Imagine a two dimensional plain on which I can exert a force
at the origin (0,0), now I want to exert that force somewhere else, let's say at (6, 0). I can use a lever with the fulcrum at
(3,0) and can transport the immovable force at the origin to the point where I want it. Here are the takeaways:

1. The beam (symmetric lever) can transport force through space.
2. The fulcrum decides the direction and manner in which that force is translated (see different types of levers in wikipedia)

More abstractly, a lever provides a way to connect different points a one/two/three dimensions. Time as well (fourth dimension).
By connect I mean something a bit more meaningful than just a line, it's some metaphysical force.

## Leverage in finance

Equity to total portfolio size
Balance Sheet (Aktiva vs Passiva)


## What is leverage?
  - using open source software is leverage -> upside and downside if
  - something breaks
  - backwards compatability in open source as insurance
  - bitcoin/linux(backwards compatible) vs ethereum (not backwards compatible)
  - debt boosts equity return but allows less variability (volatility)
  - marked-to-market important variable, find analogy for this
  - pysics definition
  - debt gives greater safety to lender at cost of making equity more fragile
  - "The shadow banking system is levered to commercial banking which
  - is levered to Central bank (FED) balance sheet" -Unchained Cap EndersGame
  - -> multiplicative factor
  - induced vulnerability to shocks (positive and negative)
  - supply chain decisions as a form of leverage (ultimate efficiency)
  - relationship between debt and leverage
  - also called gearing in the UK
  - too much leverage leads to binary outcomes -> from working to broken -> sensitivity to change too high
  - leverage connects
  - the fulcrum decides the direction
  - Quote from some greek: "Give me lever long enough and a fulcrum to put it on and I will move the world"
