## Low Time Preference Engineering
  - intro to high vs low time preference
  - buildings built to last vs US housing
  - Package Management: NixOS vs other package managers
  - Comparing Operating systems (the beginnings)
  -


## Protocols vs Data Formats
  - [Word processors are stupid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0nCEGTlTqM)
  - lock-in effect of data formats like .docx and other proprietary ones



## What is leverage?
  - using open source software is leverage -> upside and downside if
  - something breaks
  - backwards compatability in open source as insurance
  - bitcoin/linux(backwards compatible) vs ethereum (not backwards compatible)
  - debt boosts equity return but allows less variability (volatility)
  - marked-to-market important variable, find analogy for this
  - pysics definition
  - debt gives greater safety to lender at cost of making equity more fragile
  - "The shadow banking system is levered to commercial banking which
  - is levered to Central bank (FED) balance sheet" -Unchained Cap EndersGame
  - -> multiplicative factor
  - induced vulnerability to shocks (positive and negative)
  - supply chain decisions as a form of leverage (ultimate efficiency)
  - relationship between debt and leverage
  - also called gearing in the UK
  - too much leverage leads to binary outcomes -> from working to broken -> sensitivity to change too high
  - leverage connects
  - the fulcrum decides the direction
  - Quote from some greek: "Give me lever long enough and a fulcrum to put it on and I will move the world"

## What is capital?
  - Open-source code as a new, incredibly valuable form of capital (it doesn't directly cost and has a network effect)
  - Capital should be thought of as a verb; it needs constant work and is always evolving -> see The Dao of Capital
  - Fuzziness of capital
  - Uncertain captial(equity) vs less uncertain capital(debt)
  - Risk vs Uncertainty
  - Cost of capital
  - spending money on capital is an experiment (just like in poker)
  - capital investment is long-term
  - prices reflected through money is short-term
  - Capital like the fertile ground of the jungle. It supports complexity/life
  - Allen: "Money emerges from uncertainty, capital emerges from money, and uncertainty emerges from capital."


## What is liquidity?
  - banks as liquidity providers.
  - Lightning network pools
  - Jack Mallers Zap
  - The end of the FX market
  - Paper gains meme with elephant
  - competitive liquidity and routing on LN
  - deeper markets leads to better lending
  - people prefer deep markets; the deepest market should be for money

## What is a bank?
  - central banks as man-in-the-middle attacks
  - central banks supress entropy in one place (price stability) but create
  - more chaos/risk in another domain (erosion of middle class/war/etc.)
  - create an oligarchy (legacy system)
  - modelling a bank with bitcoin and lightning
  - Banks not only custody assets -> you lend assets to banks so they can
  - work with the assets -> lend, trade, etc.
  - Banks as intermediaries that make money through the spread -> levers
  - pockets of ordered capital/money -> unordered less effective (like roman
  - legions vs hoard of barbarians)
  - low entropy=order=high energy

  - Ideal system: Crowdfunding, Problem: information, maturity mismatch, risk appetite
  - Solution-> Banks as pools and intermediaries. Actual: banks as money multipliers
  - Read Allen article section with the video


## What is money?
  - Anchor of certainty in a sea of Uncertain capital
  - Like the 0 in the natural numbers
  - Money as energy (physics definition) vs power (physics definition)
  - The toxic link between money and debt in the modern economy through banks!


## What is a DCF?
  - Financalization in general
  - Pulling value from the future and crystallizing in the present
  - Tie back to time and energy


## What is inflation?
  -  basket of goods, define as vector
  -  energy conservation of the system
  -  energy and information content of products
  -  deflationary vs inflationary goods/products/services
  -  everyone has their own definition of inflation -> make software tool so
  -  individuals can calculate
  -  energy-intensity as measure for asset hardness -> ribeye steaks
  -  you can't aggegrate it into one index number (CPI)
  -  early retirement (find fixed rate risk free asset), real estate
  -  mechanism for theft -> reallocate wealth (keynesian ideology)
  -  "you can't tell people what to think but you can tell them what to think
  -  about"


## What are interest rates?
  - price of money (capital)
  - money is tool for time and energy
  - interest rate price of time and energy
  - if negative then reversing time (unnatural or even impossible)
  - price stability is unatural\false goal (goes against entropy)


## Bitcoin Full nodes vs Miners?
  - Assymmetry between creating proof and validation proof
  - Validate transactions and see if adhering to agreed upon ruleset
  - Check if block is within compliant framework of network
  - Bitcoin is not a democracy (majority rule) it is rough consensus
  - Forks resolve powerful minority decisions -> 2017 bigger blocks, miners vs users


## Quorum functions/sensing?
  - my thesis
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum_sensing
  - swarm intelligence
  - school of fish, flock of birds, etc.
